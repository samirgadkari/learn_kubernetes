Host an app that:
- takes ~ 20 seconds to load all required assets
- is ready to start taking requests as soon as it starts up
- pod should restart itself, if app crashes

Todo:
- Create a new namespace for the pod
- Create pod config file
- Issue the command to create the pod
- Test the pod to make sure it is working as expected
